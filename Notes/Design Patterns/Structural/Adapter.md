The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with other classes.

>[!Example]
>The Adapter pattern can be used when you have a class (Adaptee) with a method that needs to be used by a class (Client) with a different interface. An Adapter class is created that implements the Client's interface while using the Adaptee's method.
