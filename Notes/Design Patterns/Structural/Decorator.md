The Decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to sub classing for extending functionality.

>[!Example]
>You have a base class (Component) that provides a basic functionality. Decorator classes extend this functionality by adding new behaviors. You can wrap a Component with multiple Decorators to create a chain of behaviors.
