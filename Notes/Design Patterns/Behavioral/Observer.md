The Observer pattern defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

>[!Example]
>In an Observer pattern, a Subject maintains a list of observers that need to be notified when its state changes. Observers subscribe to the Subject and get notified when the Subject's state changes.
