The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is useful when you want to control access to a shared resource, such as a configuration manager or a logging service.

>[!Example]
>The Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. This can be achieved by defining a private constructor and providing a static method to access the instance.
