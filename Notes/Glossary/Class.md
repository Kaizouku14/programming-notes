In programming, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of that class will have. Think of a class as a mold that shapes the characteristics and actions of objects based on its specifications.

A class encapsulates data and functionality together, allowing you to create multiple instances (objects) of that class with consistent attributes and behaviors. Objects created from a class share the same structure but can have different values for their attributes.

>If you're building a program to model cars, you might define a class called "Car" that specifies attributes like "color," "make," and "model," as well as methods like "startEngine" and "drive."

In many programming languages, classes also support the concept of inheritance, where you can create new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their properties and behaviors while adding or modifying them as needed. This promotes code reuse and organization.
